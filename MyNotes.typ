== Terminology

I would do well to define these terms in the text and use them consistently.

/ System: The actual system in use.
/ Model: A model of the system used for shielding, verification and probably also training.
  / MDP: You know.
  / HMDP: Or whatever. 
/ Shield: A component that enforces safety onto the model.
/ Controller: A decision making algorithm thingy that is meant to act upon the system to achieve some outcome.
/ Agent: A kind of controller, reinforcement learning implied. 
/ Trace: Created from a controller and a model. 
/ Real-world outcome: Created from a controller acting upon a system.

== Questions for my supervisors
==== Kim
 
 - Can we go through the PhD page with instructions for submitting the thesis? I want to know when I should be doing what.
 - Please have a look at my proposed structure and tell me what you think.
 - The terms pre- and post-shielding seem to have had two competing definitions. Please give me some feedback for my section on the matter.
 - When I discuss the origin of the term "shielding," should I cite both _On Time with Minimal Expected Cost_ and _UPPAAL STRATEGO,_ or just the latter?

==== Christian

 - Please have a look at my proposed structure and tell me what you think.
